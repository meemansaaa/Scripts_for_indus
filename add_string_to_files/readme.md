## Script to append file names in a folder 

To run the script:
1. Open the folder in a terminal
2. Make a folder (e.g. 'input_files) in your working directory where all the input files will be present. 
3. Paste your 'input_folder' path in the config.yaml file in the 'dir_path' variable
4. In the terminal, write the following command 

```python 
python ./add_string.py --batch Batch-XXX
```
Here 'Batch-XXX' can be any string you want to append at the end of the file names. 


--batch argument will add the required string which is desired to be appended.
